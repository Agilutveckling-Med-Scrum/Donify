# DO NOT WRITE CODE ON THE MAIN
# CREATE A BRANCH INSTEAD

## Basic Git Workflow

1. Start everyday with git pull and solve merge conflicts if there are any.
2. Write meaingful commits messaes so others know what you have done.
3. Work on your branch and let someone else review your code upon merge.

  Code, get frustrated, google, cry, jump for joy and repeat! XD
